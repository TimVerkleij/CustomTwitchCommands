# CustomTwitchCommands
This is a simple API for custom twitch commands. It enables you to use big and complex commands that you wouldn't be able to make inside Nightbot or StreamElements since you're limited to 400 characters.

## Prerequisites
All you need to run this API is `node.js` installed on your device.
Besides that you also need to install a few packages which can be found in the package.json file under `dependencies`.

## Running the project
To run this API you only need to run the following command in the root folder of the project.
```
node index.js
```

If it is unable to find the `index.js` file make sure you're in the correct folder.
